class ModelWithPrefetchSnooping(object):
    """
        Adds a has_prefetched method to a model, which indicates whether the specified
        relation has been prefetched with prefetch_related. This knowledge can be used
        to optimise methods that follow the relation: if it has been prefetched, then
        it's probably more efficient to refine the cached result in Python, rather than
        running a whole new SQL query.

        Borrowing the pizza example from https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.4/ref/models/querysets/#prefetch-related :

        class Pizza(models.Model):
            def spicy_toppings(self):
                return self.toppings.filter(spicy=True)

        would do an unnecessary query if the Pizza instance had been built from
        Pizza.objects.prefetch_related('toppings'). An improvement would be:

        class Pizza(ModelWithPrefetchSnooping, models.Model):
            def spicy_toppings(self):
                if self.has_prefetched('toppings'):
                    return [topping from topping in self.toppings.all() if topping.spicy == True]
                else:
                    return self.toppings.filter(spicy=True)
    """

    def has_prefetched(self, relation_name):
        try:
            return (relation_name in self._prefetched_objects_cache)
        except AttributeError:
            return False
